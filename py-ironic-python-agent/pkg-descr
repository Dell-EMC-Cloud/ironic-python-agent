An agent for controlling and deploying Ironic controlled baremetal nodes.

The ironic-python-agent works with the agent driver in Ironic to provision the node. Starting with ironic-python-agent running on a ramdisk on the unprovisioned node, Ironic makes API calls to ironic-python-agent to provision the machine. This allows for greater control and flexibility of the entire deployment process.

The ironic-python-agent may also be used with the original Ironic pxe drivers as of the Kilo OpenStack release.
